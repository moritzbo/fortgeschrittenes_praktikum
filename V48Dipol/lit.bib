abstract="Statistical physics is the theory that relates macroscopic properties of materials to their microscopic constitution. Obviously a detailed study of systems containing on the order of 1023 particles is out of the question, actually even useless, so we must resort to statistical methods. There are many ways to introduce statistical mechanics, of which we will present two. Besides this, there are several different `models', called ensembles, to arrive at a relation between microscopic and macroscopic properties of materials. Although these ensembles in principle are different, for sufficiently large systems they provide identical results. While developing statistical physics we will automatically construct thermodynamics, a macroscopic theory of invaluable help in describing for example phase transitions. In principle no knowledge of thermodynamics is assumed in order to understand the present notes, although obviously it will be of great help to have some acquaintance with it.",

abstract = {Abstract The concentration of impurity–vacancy dipoles in potassium bromide crystals doped with strontium bromide was measured using the ionic thermocurrent (ITC) technique. The parameters of the dipole relaxation are: fundamental relaxation time 4 × 10−14s, activation enthalpy 0.66 eV. The effect of 60Co γ-irradiation at room temperature was to reduce the number of dipoles and to increase the number of trapped holes and electrons, but the number of trapped holes and electrons, measured by optical absorption, was about 30 times smaller than the number of dipoles destroyed. It is proposed that the effect of irradiation is to increase the rate of aggregation of dipoles, primarily into trimer aggregates, through temporary electron trapping by strontium ions.},
